# Personal-Website
Practicing HTML, CSS, Javascript by designing personal website. 

This repository contains several branches each of which is a website I have created to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
skills. To view each website, simply clone the repo and all the nessecary files should be there for the website to be 
viewed when the index.html file is opened.

Enjoy :)
