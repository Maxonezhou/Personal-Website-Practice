                            InBrace is a novel approach to tackling the disease of multiple sclerosis by utilizing two 
                            pressure sensitive senors that actuated two servo motors attached to the elbow joint of the 
                            chassis of the arm brace when activated. As the patient raises their arm, the senors located 
                            on the insides of the chassis senses the movement and applies a variable force to the motors 
                            meaning that as more force is applied to the senors, the motors are activated with a higher 
                            rpm. In turn, this allows the user to perform everyday tasks without the expense of losing 
                            motor functionality. Additionally, the adjustable casing of the arm brace allows users to 
                            customize the brace to their specific body shape and needs.

                                OnSight is a fully integrated end-to-end solution that connects 
                                first responders, coordinators, and citizens into one centralized 
                                disaster response coordination system. As citizens make 911 calls,
                                the Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa can extract important details
                                which are transmitted to a Realtime Database in the cloud. These 
                                reports are processed using the Google Places API to obtain the 
                                exact location of the issue. The details of these reports, along 
                                with a map showing their locations, are displayed on a web portal. 
                                Control Centre personnel can monitor these reports in realtime and 
                                relay them to first responders. First responders are equipped with 
                                IoT smart glasses, which connect to nearby Wi-Fi networks and pull 
                                new data from the database in real time. The data is processed on 
                                the edge, where it is intelligently parsed and displayed according 
                                to priority.
